# my-personal-website
Welcome to my personal website! This site showcases my skills, projects and experience as a 
frontend developer.
## live demo
file://wsl.localhost/Ubuntu-22.04/home/stacywaithera/Development/projects/personal-project/index.html

## Home page
This is the first page of my website with some of my information. And the home, about, experience, projects and contact buttons.

## About page
For this I give more information about myself (mostly of my education.)

## Experience page
I give my experience as a front-end developer.

## Projects page
Here I have given information about the projects I have worked on.
## contact page
For anyone who would like to contact me I provided an email address.
## Profile photo
I achieved this by using the img tag
<img src="images/stacy.jpg" alt="Stacy Waithera" class="profile-img">

## linking js to our html
<script src="styles.js"></script> 
The script tag helps us link our html document with our styles javascript.
## CSS
To link my html and css l used the link tag
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

### CSS
For (*) this resets the default browers settings, i.e the margin and padding to 0 while the box-sizing to border box.
The rest are self explanatory, i.e for body, this are the general stylings.
  For header this are just the header's stylings.

## JS
#### DOM : Document Object Model 
DOM allows JS to manipulate(create elements) , modify and update the content , structure and styling of a webpage.
