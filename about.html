                <p>
                    My name is Stacy Waithera, and I am a recent IT graduate from JKUAT University. During my studies, 
                    I developed a passion for web development and software engineering. I have hands-on experience 
                    working on various projects, including building a password store application for my final year project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies and enhancing my skills in frontend development. 
                    I am currently seeking opportunities to contribute to projects and grow as a professional 
                    in the tech industry.
